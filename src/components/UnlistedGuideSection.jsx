            Unlisted shares, often referred to as pre-IPO shares, represent ownership in companies that are not listed on recognized stock exchanges such as the National Stock Exchange (NSE) or Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). These shares are legally issued, fully valid equity instruments, but they are traded off-market through private arrangements rather than public exchanges.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            In recent years, unlisted shares have emerged as one of the fastest-growing alternative investment segments in India, attracting retail investors, High Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs), family offices, venture capitalists, and long-term value investors.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The growing interest in companies like NSE India, Tata Capital, HDB Financial Services, SBI General Insurance, and ICICI Lombard (before IPO) has pushed unlisted equity investing into the mainstream.
